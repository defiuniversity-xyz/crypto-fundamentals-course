          ],
          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "The revolutionary aspect of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is that you can send value directly to another person without needing a bank, PayPal, or any company in the middle to approve or process it. It's peer-to-peer."

          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "Your bank balance is the bank's promise to give you money. They can freeze your account, set withdrawal limits, or even fail. You're asking permission to use 'your' money. With crypto, you hold the actual asset."

          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "In countries with hyperinflation or capital controls, crypto offers a way to store value outside the local system and access global markets. It can be a lifeline when local currency rapidly loses value."

          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "Your PayPal balance is an IOU - PayPal owes you that money. Bitcoin you hold in your own wallet is actually yours, like cash in your pocket. No company is in the middle promising to give it to you."

          "correctAnswer": "b",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "Crypto treats all countries equally. There are no correspondent banks taking cuts or adding delays. A transaction from Argentina to Philippines costs the same and takes the same time as one across the street."

            {"id": "a", "text": "Because crypto never fails"},
            {"id": "b", "text": "Because the network is run by thousands of computers worldwide - no one server can be shut down to stop it"},
            {"id": "c", "text": "Because the government backs it up"},

          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "Traditional systems have central servers - if they go down, everything stops. Crypto networks are distributed across thousands of computers globally. There's no headquarters to raid or server to crash."

          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "Peer-to-peer means person to person directly. When you hand cash to a friend, that's peer-to-peer. Crypto enables this digitally - your value goes directly to them without passing through a bank or company."

          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "This is a crucial lesson: 'Not your keys, not your coins.' If you keep crypto in your own wallet (with your own keys), it's truly yours. If you leave it on an exchange, you're trusting that company - and companies can fail."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "Self-custody means you control the keys to your crypto - no exchange or company holds them for you. It's like holding physical cash versus having money in a bank. More responsibility, but also true ownership."

            {"id": "a", "text": "Because the coins are see-through"},
            {"id": "b", "text": "Because all transactions are recorded publicly, so anyone can verify the rules are being followed"},

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "Most crypto transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain. Anyone can verify that no one is cheating - no hidden money printing, no secret transactions. This transparency builds trust without requiring trust in a specific company."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "With great power comes great responsibility. No middleman means no customer support to fix your mistakes. Send to the wrong address? Those funds may be gone forever. You must be careful because you're in full control."

          "correctAnswer": "b",
          "explanation": "Creating a basic crypto wallet takes seconds and requires no personal information, no approval, no minimum balance. This is why crypto is 'permissionless' - the barrier to entry is nearly zero for anyone with internet access."
