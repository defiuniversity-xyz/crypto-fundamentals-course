# Types of Wallets

![Header](https://storage.googleapis.com/crypto-fundamentals-media/images/lesson_12/crypto-fundamentals_12_header.png)


**Core concept:** Different wallet types trade off between security and convenience—like choosing between a safe deposit box and your pocket wallet.

## Safe Deposit Box vs. Pocket Wallet


![Inline Analogy](https://storage.googleapis.com/crypto-fundamentals-media/images/lesson_12/crypto-fundamentals_12_inline_analogy.png)

For storing cash, you might use:

**Pocket wallet:** Convenient. Always with you. But limited capacity and more vulnerable to theft or loss.

**Home safe:** More secure than pocket. Holds more. But requires being home to access.

**Bank safe deposit box:** Very secure. Rarely accessed. But inconvenient, limited hours, and you trust the bank.

Crypto wallets exist on a similar spectrum. The most secure options are less convenient; the most convenient options are less secure.

## Hot Wallets: Connected and Convenient

**What they are:** Software wallets connected to the internet. Mobile apps, browser extensions, desktop applications.

**Examples:** MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom

**Pros:**
- Free and easy to set up
- Instant access for transactions
- Great for interacting with DeFi apps
- Can hold multiple cryptocurrencies

**Cons:**
- Connected to internet = exposed to online threats
- Only as secure as your phone/computer
- Vulnerable to malware, phishing, hacks
- Not ideal for large amounts

**Best for:** Daily use, small amounts, interacting with decentralized apps, learning.

---

## Cold Wallets: Disconnected and Secure

**What they are:** Wallets that keep private keys offline, never exposed to internet.

**Types:**

### Hardware Wallets
Dedicated devices (like USB drives) that store keys and sign transactions offline.

**Examples:** Ledger, Trezor, GridPlus

**Pros:**
- Keys never touch the internet
- Resistant to computer malware
- Physical button confirms transactions
- Support many cryptocurrencies

**Cons:**
- Cost $60-200+
- Less convenient for frequent use
- Can be lost/damaged
- Still need to protect seed phrase

**Best for:** Long-term storage, significant amounts, security-focused users.

### Paper Wallets
Private key printed on paper, stored physically.

**Pros:** Totally offline. Free. Simple.

**Cons:** Easy to damage/lose. Less practical for actual use. Largely replaced by hardware wallets.

---

## Custodial Wallets: Someone Else Holds Keys

**What they are:** Accounts on exchanges or services where the company holds the private keys.

**Examples:** Coinbase account, Kraken account, Binance account

**Pros:**
- Easiest to use
- Password recovery possible
- Company handles security
- Good for beginners
- Often has insurance

**Cons:**
- Not your keys, not your coins
- Company can freeze your account
- If company is hacked, you might lose funds
- Counter to crypto's self-custody ethos

**Best for:** Beginners, trading, fiat on/off ramps, amounts you're comfortable trusting to a company.

## The Security Spectrum


![Infographic](https://storage.googleapis.com/crypto-fundamentals-media/images/lesson_12/crypto-fundamentals_12_infographic.png)

From most convenient to most secure:

```
Custodial    →    Hot Wallet    →    Hardware Wallet    →    Paper/Steel
Exchange         Mobile App          Ledger/Trezor          Metal Backup

More convenient                                      More secure
Less control                                         More control
Less responsibility                                  More responsibility
```

Most experienced users use multiple types:
- Custodial exchange for trading
- Hot wallet for daily DeFi use
- Hardware wallet for savings
- Metal backup for seed phrases

---

## Multi-Signature Wallets

Advanced option: wallets requiring multiple keys to authorize transactions.

**Example:** 2-of-3 multisig requires 2 out of 3 designated keys to approve any transaction.

**Benefits:**
- No single point of failure
- Good for organizations
- Additional security layer

**Drawbacks:**
- More complex to set up and use
- All key-holders must coordinate

Used by: DAOs, companies, high-net-worth individuals, careful families sharing control.

---

## Choosing What's Right for You

**Beginners:** Start with a custodial exchange to learn, then explore hot wallets as you grow comfortable.

**Regular users:** Hot wallet for daily use, hardware wallet for savings.

**Large holdings:** Hardware wallet primary, possibly multi-sig for very large amounts.

**DeFi active users:** Hot wallet necessary for app interactions, but transfer to cold storage after.

The key insight: **match security to value and use case**. You don't need a $200 hardware wallet for $50 in crypto. You shouldn't keep $50,000 in a mobile app.

## Key Takeaways

- **Hot wallets** are convenient but internet-connected, best for daily use and smaller amounts
- **Hardware wallets** keep keys offline, best for larger holdings and long-term storage
- **Custodial wallets** (exchanges) are easiest but you don't control the keys
- **Security and convenience trade off**—choose based on your needs
- **Most users should use multiple wallet types** for different purposes
- **Match security to value**—don't over- or under-protect
