# 24/7 Never Closed

**Core concept:** Cryptocurrency networks run continuously—no banking hours, no holidays, no weekends off. Your money is always accessible.

## The ATM That Never Sleeps


![Inline Analogy](https://storage.googleapis.com/crypto-fundamentals-media/images/lesson_04/crypto-fundamentals_04_inline_analogy.png)

Imagine an ATM that:
- Works at 3 AM on a Tuesday
- Works on Christmas Day
- Works during hurricane power outages (if you have internet)
- Works in every country simultaneously
- Never has "system maintenance" downtime

That's what cryptocurrency networks are like. They don't have operating hours because there's no office to close.

Traditional finance runs on business hours:
- Banks close at 5 PM
- Markets close on weekends
- Holidays shut everything down
- International transfers wait for both time zones

Cryptocurrency runs on computer hours:
- Networks operate continuously
- Transactions process at 2 AM
- Sunday is the same as Monday
- There's no "after hours"

## Why Traditional Finance Has Hours

Banks have operating hours because:

**Human processing:** Historically, people processed transactions. People need sleep, weekends, and holidays.

**Batch systems:** As covered earlier, many banking systems batch transactions overnight rather than processing them continuously.

**Synchronized settlement:** Markets and banks coordinate with each other, requiring agreed-upon hours.

**Risk management:** Having defined hours helps institutions manage risk and reconcile accounts.

These reasons made sense when humans handled everything. They're increasingly outdated in a digital world—but changing deeply embedded systems is slow.

## How Crypto Stays "Always On"

Cryptocurrency networks don't need business hours because:

**Decentralized operation:** Thousands of computers worldwide run the network. When it's midnight in New York, it's noon in Tokyo. Someone's always "awake."

**Automated processing:** Transactions are verified by code, not people. Code doesn't need lunch breaks.

**No single point of control:** There's no central office that can "close." The network IS all the computers running it.

**Aligned incentives:** The people running network computers (miners/validators) are paid for processing transactions, so they keep running 24/7.

The result: Bitcoin has had 99.98% uptime since 2009. Traditional banks might go down for maintenance. Bitcoin doesn't.

## Real-World Impact

Always-on matters when:

**Time-sensitive transactions:** Need to pay someone urgently on Sunday night? Crypto can do that. Bank transfer will wait until Monday.

**Global business:** Working with people in different time zones? No need to coordinate around banking hours.

**Emergencies:** Financial crises don't wait for Monday. Neither should your ability to access money.

**Market opportunities:** While stock markets sleep, crypto markets trade. Some see opportunity; others see stress.

Always-on matters less when:

**You're not in a hurry:** If Tuesday is fine, 24/7 is just theoretical.

**You prefer markets to close:** Some appreciate forced breaks from market watching.

---

## The Flip Side: Always On Trading

There's a psychological dimension to 24/7 operation:

**No forced breaks:** Stock markets close, giving everyone time to step away. Crypto never pauses.

**FOMO potential:** "What if something happens while I sleep?" becomes a real concern for active traders.

**Volatility at any hour:** Price swings can happen at 4 AM when you're not watching.

For long-term holders, this doesn't matter—you're not checking prices hourly anyway.

For active traders, 24/7 markets can be exhausting. Many find they need to set personal boundaries since the market won't impose them.

## What "Uptime" Means for Your Money

Traditional banking downtime scenarios:
- "System maintenance, try again later"
- "Transaction processing is delayed"
- "Bank holiday, closed today"
- "International wire will process next business day"

Crypto uptime scenarios:
- Transaction confirmed in 10 minutes at 3 AM Sunday
- Same experience on Christmas as any other day
- Network works identically regardless of your location

This reliability makes crypto useful for applications that require always-available money—like automated payments, global operations, or situations where traditional hours are problematic.
